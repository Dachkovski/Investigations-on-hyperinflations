# Investigations on hyperinflations
This analysis includes hyperinflations from different countries and the corresponding reaction of the central bank discount rate during the currency crisis. Furthermore, correlations to population growth, real wages, unemployment rate, social inequality, market capitalization and gross domestic investment are investigated. The results of the analysis do not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.

## The report will answer the following questions:

- When and where did the biggest hyperinflations occur from 1961 to 2017 in each of the countries?
- How did the central bank discount rate change around that time ?
- Are there global trends in central bank discount rate policy?
- How did the population growth change during that time?
- What are the correlations between inflation and a) population growth, b) real income, c) unemployment rate and d) inequality?
- How do hyperinflations affect capitalizations of companies and willingness to invest?
