## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project investigates hyperinflations from different countries and the corresponding reaction of the central bank discount rate during the currency crisis. Furthermore, correlations to population growth, real wages, unemployment rate, social inequality are investigated. The results of the analysis do not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.

The report will answer the following questions:
1. When and where did the biggest hyperinflations occur from 1961 to 2017 in each of the countries and how did the central bank discount rate change around that time ?
2. Are there global trends in inflation rates and central bank discount rates?
3. What are the correlations between inflation and 
    a) population growth, 
    b) real income, 
    d) inequality?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyther notebook available to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@dennis_dachkovski/does-printing-money-cause-poverty-552b14fbbe7).
